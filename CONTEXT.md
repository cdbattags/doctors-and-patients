# general thoughts and notes

## first thoughts

- Node.js
- PM2/systemd for process management
  - can I calculate what PM2 does at the systemd level?
- Chef script to deploy this?
- Docker as well?
- Kubernetes research?
  - "Kubernetes is a container orchestration system for Docker containers that is more extensive than Docker Swarm and is meant to coordinate clusters of nodes at scale in production in an efficient manner. It works around the concept of pods, which are scheduling units (and can contain one or more containers) in the Kubernetes ecosystem, and they are distributed among nodes to provide high availability. One can easily run a Docker build on a Kubernetes cluster, but Kubernetes itself is not a complete solution and is meant to include custom plugins."
- "persistent storage"
  - let's use sqlite3 here because it's the best blend of both worlds IMO
